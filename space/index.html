            Space.
        </h1>

        <p>
            Space is pretty, deep and mysterious.
            We are all made up of star stuff and the idea that
            the stuff came together to form us is amazing.
            I also find it thrilling because it is unknown if there
            is life on other planets.

        </p>

        <p>
            No one really introduced me to space.
            Iâ€™ve always liked to look at the night sky.
            The moon is what inspired me to learn more about space.
            I think that's just because it's the closest celestial body
            that I can observe in detail without a telescope.

        </p>

        <p>
            Stars and NASA continue to inspire me.
            I love finding new stars that I haven't noticed before.
            Especially since there is a lot of light pollution in the city,
            it's very awe-inspiring when I am able to see more stars.
            I love the work that NASA does and how they share a lot of their
            knowledge with the public.
