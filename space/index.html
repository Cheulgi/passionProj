        Space.
    </h1>

    <p>
        Space is pretty, deep and mysterious.
        We are all made up of star stuff and the idea that
        the stuff came together to form us is amazing.
        I also find it thrilling because it is unknown if there
        is life on other planets.

    <p>
        No one really introduced me to space.
        Iâ€™ve always liked to look at the night sky.
        The moon is what inspired me to learn more about space.
        I think that's just because it's the closest celestial body
        that I can observe in detail without a telescope.
