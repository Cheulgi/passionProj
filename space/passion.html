Space.

Space is pretty, deep and mysterious. 
We are all made up of star stuff and the idea that 
the stuff came together to form us is amazing. 
I also find it thrilling because it is unknown if there 
is life on other planets.

No one really introduced me to space. 
Iâ€™ve always liked to look at the night sky. 
The moon is what inspired me to learn more about space. 
I think that's just because it's the closest celestial body 
that I can observe in detail without a telescope.  

Stars and NASA continue to inspire me. 
I love finding new stars that I haven't noticed before. 
Especially since there is a lot of light pollution in the city, 
it's very awe-inspiring when I am able to see more stars. 
I love the work that NASA does and how they share a lot of their 
knowledge with the public.
