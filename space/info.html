Stars and NASA continue to inspire me.
I love finding new stars that I haven't noticed before.
Especially since there is a lot of light pollution in the city,
it's very awe-inspiring when I am able to see more stars.
I love the work that NASA does and how they share a lot of their
knowledge with the public.
